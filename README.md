## Project Overview
Each cohort at NSS has a class website for potential employers to view student accomplishments prior to Demo Day. As the UX/UI half of Cohort 35 we used our class website as a protype to showcase our abilities in the design and implemenation process of user design. We bypassed the cookie cutter template that past cohorts have used and started from scratch by:
+ defining our user
+ understanding their pain points
+ creating a new website layout
+ condensing copy and information
+ observing user testing

Then deploying after user testing feedback had been considered and adjustments made.
